* Day 1
::

    * 1. Define a function which takes a string as its argument.
         It should print the characters of the string one at a time.
         First solution should use a while loop and the second solution should implement a For loop
         (Enhance the above solution)
    * 2. Define a function which will accept a string as argument and return True
         if the string is a palindrome. Palindrome is a word in English which when read backwards from the last letter
         to first spells the   same. example:- Madam, Radar, Solos etc
    * 3. Create a dictionary with keys as strings and values as integers.
         List the keys in alphabetical order. List the values from lower to higher
    * 4. Take a dictionary as input and create another dictionary by inverting the keys and values.
         ie, the values becomes the key and the keys become the values.
